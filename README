Kernels and transports are completely pluggable.

Current kernels:

* python - pure Python kernel using hashlib, as an example of a kernel and for testing
* poclbm - poclbm's OpenCL kernel, as distributed by phoenix-miner

Current transports:

* http - Standard JSON-RPC interface with:
    * long polling using X-Long-Polling header
    * indication of accepting H != 0 targets with X-All-Targets
    * work identifier support (X-Work-Identifier)
